# IMAGE-OUTLIER-DETECTION-WITH-THE-ALIBINET-DETECT-PYTHON-LIBRARY


[Alibi-Detect](https://docs.seldon.io/projects/alibi-detect/en/stable/), a Python library that is available as open source, is specifically designed to detect outliers, adversarial perturbations, and drift in various types of datasets. This comprehensive package is aimed at providing users with both online and offline detectors that can be applied to tabular data, text, images, and time series. The outlier detection methods that are included within the library have been meticulously developed and refined to enable users to accurately and effectively identify global, contextual, and collective outliers, thereby enabling a greater degree of granularity and precision in their analyses. By leveraging the sophisticated algorithms and techniques embedded within this cutting-edge tool, users can improve their detection capabilities and gain a deeper understanding of complex datasets, ultimately leading to more informed and insightful decision-making.
However, this project involves the use of only an image dataset.

The dataset can be found at https://www.mvtec.com/company/research/datasets/mvtec-ad

To use this our, you must install the alibi-detect library by running:

#### pip install alibi-detect           

            or                 

#### conda install alibi-detect (if you are using a conda environment)





Also you have install the tensorflow 2.0 and above. You can do that by running:

pip install tensorflow ==version_number 

               or 

conda install tensorflow ==version_number if you are using a conda environment.

For a better understand, the link below provides a detail summary of this library.
